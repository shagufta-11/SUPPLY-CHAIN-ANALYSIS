# SUPPLY-CHAIN-ANALYSIS
Power BI project analyzing supply chain performance to identify inefficiencies, reduce delivery delays, and improve operational efficiency through data-driven insights.

🏭 Supply Chain Analysis Dashboard

This project focuses on analyzing supply chain performance data to identify bottlenecks, monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), and improve overall efficiency. Using Power BI, I created an interactive dashboard and a diagnostic report that provides insights into inventory management, order fulfillment, transportation delays, supplier performance and realetd concerns.

🔍 Key Objectives

Analyze and visualize supply chain data for better operational understanding.

Identify delivery delays, inefficiencies, and cost-impacting areas.

Track KPIs such as delivery time, order accuracy, and product movement.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Power BI – For building interactive dashboards and reports.
power point - for creating presentation regarding the insights.
microsoft word - for creating Diagnostic report.

📊 Key Insights

Identified top-performing and underperforming products.

Reduced average delivery delays by highlighting logistics inefficiencies.

Improved decision-making with clear regional and product-level insights.

🚀 Outcome

The dashboard enables businesses to monitor end-to-end supply chain operations and make data-driven decisions to optimize performance and reduce costs. And also the diagnostic report helps them to monitor the prformance of the supply chain.
